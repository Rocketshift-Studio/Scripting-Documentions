# Getting Started
Here is complete guideline for onboarding with trophy score system.

## Setup the definitions
In order to have score in the game what we need is called Score definiiton.

**Here are the steps to setup a score definiiton:**
1. In project window, choose Create > Trophy > Score Definition
2. In the Score Definition inspector define unique key
3. Go to trophy settings using Tools > Rocketshift Studio > Trophy > Settings
4. In the settings editor's score definition array add a entry and assign the definition in there.

## The metadata & formats
When it comes to showing scores to the user it requires some additional information to do that. Even thought the metadata part of the definition is self explainatory yet here are the use of these informations
