  summary: >-
    Apologies for my poor explanation:


    Inside the editor, Unity doesn't let certain tasks to be done on the same frame the script calls them.

    So, they have to created with EditorApplication.delayCall.

    A lot of things can cause issues with this. 

    For example: if the script reloads while a task is on delay call, the reloaded script isn't the one that called the delay call. 

    This can result in leftover letter getting created but no text that they belong to. (Usually as a copy).

    This is super rare but can be annoying if it happens


    This script handles this issue.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: >-
      [ExecuteAlways]

      public class DelayCallCharacterCleanUp : MonoBehaviour
    content.vb: >-
      <ExecuteAlways>
